/**
 * First well import variables. All website specific
 * and repettitive values should reside in there.
 *
 * That includes fonts, colors, base font-sizes, etc.
 *
 * TIP: You can also change the values of included
 * packages in scss. i.e.: You want that bootstrap
 * primary color to be different and them buttons
 * aren't just round enough? Just add following variables:
 *
 * $brand-primary: #fefa33;
 * $btn-border-radius-base: 50%;
 *
 * Checkout a complete list of BS variables:
 * https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss
 *
 * PRO TIP!@@#$: By tweaking the BS variables you can get very close
 * to almost any design you'll need to implement with using nothing
 * but bootstrap markup. This way you'll keep your code dry, won't
 * pollute it with custom html and styles and make it
 * managable to any other developer that might come by.
